# nodejs-project-example

This is the structure for a Node.js project. It is using `mocha` and `chai` for testing and `nyc` for coverage, `eslint` as a code linter with recommended preset and `prettier` as code formatter. `typescript` is used just for Javascript type checking using _JSDoc_ comments.
