nodejs-project-example
===
This is the structure for a Node.js project. It is using `mocha` and `chai` for testing and `instanbul` for coverage, `nodemon` in npm watch to detect changes in files and `eslint` as a code linter with airbnb-base preset.

This example is not using a task runner like `grunt` or `gulp`, instead of that, the necessary scripts were written in the file *package.json* which is faster and smaller than install a task runner, plugins, read the documentation of the plugins before to be able to using them, etc.
